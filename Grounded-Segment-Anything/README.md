In this tutorial, we explore AI-driven image processing using Grounding DINO, SAM (Segment Anything Model), Stable Diffusion and your own prompt !!!!

This step-by-step guide covers everything from model loading and image preprocessing to detecting, segmenting, and generating new images. 

<br/><br/> 
What you’ll learn:

* How to install the environment and the required Python libraries
* How to use GroundingDINO with your own text prompt to detect objects in your image
* How to use Segment Anything to segment your object in the image 
* How to use Stable Diffusion inpainting to replace the object with your own prompt !!
