<font size= "4" >
Welcome to our latest Python tutorial, where we dive into the world of image processing! 
In this video, we'll guide you through the process of removing backgrounds from images using Pre-trained model basied on PyTorch : The Rembg library.


<br/><br/> 

The tutorial is divided into four parts:

🖼️ Part 1: Install the necessary Python libraries for image processing.

🧠 Part 2: Import and manipulate images using the OpenCV .

🚀 Part 3: Use PyTorch as Deeplearning framework with the pre-trained background removal code.

🔮 Part 4: Demonstration of the background removal on your images
