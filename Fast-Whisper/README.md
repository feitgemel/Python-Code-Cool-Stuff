Faster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.

This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. 

We will learn how to implement automatic transcription of audio and video, allowing us to generate SRT subtitles. Additionally, we will learn how to produce subtitles in other languages

<br/><br/> 
What you’ll learn:

* How to install the environment and the required Python libraries
* How to transcribe a simple audio file into text
* How to transcribe a video file into text
* How to create subtitle file (SRT) in English and how to translate it to any desired langua
