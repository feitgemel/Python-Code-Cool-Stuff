In this tutorial, we will use Hugging Face’s pre-trained 'nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning' model.

You'll learn how to easily generate descriptive captions for any image using Python and PyTorch. We’ll walk you through setting up the Vision Transformer (ViT) for image processing and GPT-2 for text generation.
<br/><br/> 
What you’ll learn:

* How to install the environment and the required Python libraries
* How to load and use pre-trained models from Hugging Face
* Process images with Vision Transformers (ViT)
* Generate text with GPT-2 in PyTorch
* Display and merge the images and the captioning result
