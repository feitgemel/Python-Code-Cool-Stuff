Summary : <br/>


<font size= "4" >
In this tutorial, we're diving into the world of deepfakes and face swapping using the Roop Python library. 
The goal of this video is to replace faces in a video with just one image, without the need for training or extensive datasets. 
You'll be able to create face swap effects in no time.

<br/><br/> 

The tutorial is divided into 2 parts:

🖼️ Part 1: Setting Up the Environment: Setting up the proper environment by creating a Conda environment , installing the Roop library and other essential Python packages. 

🧠 Part 2: Running the App: Once your environment is ready, We'll show you how to run the app using your input files : video and any face image.
