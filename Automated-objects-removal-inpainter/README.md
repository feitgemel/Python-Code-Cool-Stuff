Automated object remover Inpainter is a project that combines Semantic segmentation and EdgeConnect architectures with minor changes in order to remove specified objects from photos. For Semantic Segmentation, the code from Pytorch has been adapted, whereas for EdgeConnect, the code has been adapted from

This project is capable of removing objects from list of 20 different ones. It can be used as photo editing tool as well as for Data augmentation.

What you’ll learn:

* How to install the environment and the required Python libraries
* How to remove one object out of an image 
* How to remove several objects
